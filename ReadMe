I learned a lot through working on the final project. I gained a lot of practice and an extended knowledge of segues, firestore, github, and handleing user interaction such as a tap or swipe. I additionally learned a good bit on having multiple users through firebase authentication and implmentating a slider function. I still have work to do on the project as I have to finish the mutliplayer aspect. MVP Demonstration video: https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/540718144
